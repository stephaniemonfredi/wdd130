            <h3>Client Report</h3>
            <p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</p>
            <li>I searched up Iceland pictures on a website with free pictures and then I sent them to the Lead. </li>
            <p>How did you communicate with your developer? Were there any issues with communication?</p>
            <li>I think I communicated pretty well with my Lead developer the only problem was that my images would not go into the google docs so he could see my images better so I had to optimize them.</li>
            <p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</p>
            <li>The developer did but I can only see the home page and the images are not showing up. Personally I feel like I could have done better by my self.</li>
            <p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</p>
            <li>I would pick a group that all want to do it and who show up and work on my website.</li>

            <h3>Lead Developer Report</h3>
            <p>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks to your junior devs?</p>
            <li>I told all of my junior developers the pages they were assigned when I was suppose to. There was a little miscommunication with one of my members Ben Ison did not know there was a team on teams and was not getting the messages. He was added to the group but he did not tell me there was a problem I had to find out why he was not doing his work myself. The other developer Justin Rodriguez did his work pretty well and without issue. As I am writing this right now Ben Ison has not done anything that I can see but he is working on it and he has finally excepted the GitHub</li>
            <p>How did you communicate with your client? Were there any issues?</p>
            <li>There were no issues connecting with my client. When I needed more information Jack Dyer got it to me right away.</li>
            <p>How did you handle publishing your client's site and sharing it with the client?</p>
            <li>Publishing my clients site and sharing it with them wa one of the first things I did.</li>
            <p>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</p>
            <li>It was rocky to say the least but I think I was sorta able to figure it out.</li>
